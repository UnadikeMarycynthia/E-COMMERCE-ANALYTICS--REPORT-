# E-COMMERCE-ANALYTICS--REPORT-
2023 E-Commerce Sales Performance Report Analyzing Profitability, Customer Segments, Category Strategy, and Sales Momentum. 
About the Business
This report focuses on a modern, fast-scaling e-commerce company specializing in a diverse catalog of products—from furniture to tech, office essentials to home accessories. The dashboard was developed in Power BI as a strategic tool to monitor sales efficiency, profitability, and consumer behavior across categories and segments. The company’s leadership relies on this report to shape promotional strategy, inventory planning, and category-level investment.
Pre-Analysis: Questions That Guided the Insight
Going into this dashboard build, I wanted to explore key business questions:

What’s the overall health of our sales and profitability this year?

Which product categories are revenue leaders versus profit champions?

How do segments like Corporate, Consumer, and Home Office compare in contribution?

Are there specific months or products that drive seasonal peaks?

These questions framed both the data shaping and the structure of the visuals. The goal was to provide leadership with a dashboard that was visually elegant, real-time, and rooted in clarity.
In-Analysis: Visuals with Purpose
Every section of this dashboard contributes to a larger narrative:

Headline KPIs
Total Sales: $2M

Total Profit: $286K

Orders: 5,009

Expenses: $2.01M

Earnings This Month: $352K

These KPIs create a fast, high-level snapshot of performance. Notably, the narrow gap between sales and expenses flags a potential margin challenge, despite strong revenue flow.

Sales Trend (Line Chart: Jan–Dec)
This visual uncovers a rolling momentum across the year with revenue peaks in:

March: $206K

September: $308K

October: $352K — highest of the year

December: $325K
These patterns suggest key seasonal moments—likely tied to campaign pushes, back-to-school surges, and year-end shopping. Marketing teams can use this data to double down during peak periods.

Profit by Sub-Category (Pie Chart)
Top contributors include:

Phones: $45K

Paper: $34K

Storage: $21K
Although not necessarily the top revenue drivers, these are profit engines. It’s essential to protect and optimize these categories with strong supplier relationships and bundled promotions.

Sales by Segment (Pie Chart)
Consumer: $432K

Corporate: $285K

Home Office: $168K

The Consumer segment dominates, confirming that general public purchasing is the lifeblood of sales. However, Corporate is a stable second—offering opportunity for loyalty programs or B2B deals.
Top Products (Card Visuals)
Chairs lead at $328K — likely due to WFH dynamics or office refits.

Copiers at $150K signal backend operations (office management) still carry weight.
Final Observations
Profitability and expenses must be monitored closely—while sales are high, the tight profit margin (less than 15%) suggests rising overheads or discount dependencies.

Peak months should anchor strategic planning—October and December, especially, call for promotional amplification.

Phones and Paper are silent heroes in the profit conversation.

Chairs are the brand front-runners and could serve as entry points for customer acquisition or bulk discounts.
Why Power BI Was the Ideal Choice
This dashboard was brought to life in Power BI for its ability to:

Redefining Success in E-Commerce
Success today isn’t just about sales volume — it’s about profitable growth. This dashboard shows how data can highlight strengths, warn of bottlenecks, and light up opportunities.
